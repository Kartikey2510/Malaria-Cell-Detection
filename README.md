# Malaria-Cell-Detection
The model is used to find whether the blood smear images contains malaria or not.
The model is built using tensorflow and uses convolution neural netwroks as feature extractors.
The model is built using custom layers and also through transfer learning using inceptionV3 model.
Lastly, the comparison between two is shown.
